    Testing the OAK cameras

Currently you can test the camera(s) in two ways. Both are using Luxonis example repositorys.

To get started, you can either follow the guide below, or just run the scripts in the ./scripts folder.

Everything is done in Ubuntu 22.04!

## Using with ROS

Firstly, to use the camera with ROS, you need to install ROS on the system.

**NB!** This guide assumes you are on Ubuntu!

First we start with installing ROS. For that, we ensure that the Ubuntu Uinverse repository is enabled.

```
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository universe

```

Then, we add the ROS2 GPG key and add repository to the sources list

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl -y
sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg

echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo $UBUNTU_CODENAME) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null

```

After all that is done, you need to update repository caches and then ensure that system is up to date.

```
sudo apt update
sudp apt upgrade
```

And now we can install the ROS!

Because they are quite big files, they take some time to install

```
sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop
sudo apt install ros-humble-ros-base
sudo apt install ros-dev-tools
```

And now you have ROS installed on your system!

Now we can download the example codes, that you can play around with the camera.

Firstly we need to install some binaries.

```
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="03e7", MODE="0666"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/80-movidius.rules
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger

sudo apt install ros-humble-depthai-ros

sudo wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luxonis/depthai-ros/main/install_dependencies.sh | sudo bash

```

And also, we need some Python stuff, to use the camera.

```
sudo apt install ibopencv-dev
sudo apt install python-rosdep
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update
```

Now we also need to have the example files installed, for that, use these commands:

```
mkdir -p camera/src
cd camera/src
git clone --branch humble https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-ros.git
cd ..
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash

MAKEFLAGS="-j1 -l1" colcon build

source install/setup.bash

```

And finally to run a example code, you need to run these final lines:

```
cd camera
source install/setup.bash

ros2 launch depthai_examples stereo_inertial_node.launch.py


```


Now you can start testing the camera!

If you want to 3D map the image, you also need to install it first:

```
sudo apt install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-rtabmap-ros
```

And to run it, run this command:

```
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch depthai_ros_driver rtabmap.launch.py
```

## Using with OpenCV

Getting started with OpenCV, is quite simple. All you need to do, is follow few steps.

Firstly, run this script:

```bash
sudo wget -qO- https://docs.luxonis.com/install_depthai.sh | bash
```

This installs DepthAI on your Linux system.

Next, connect camera with your PC.

```bash
cd depthai
sudo apt-get update
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt-get install python3.9
python3 depthai_demo.py
```

With this, you can start testing the camera and play around with variables.
